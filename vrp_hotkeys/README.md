# vrp_hotkeys
fx-server only

Hotkeys , based on Sighmir's work , i added a cooldown command when you die and there are no ems online , so you'll have to wait 1 minute before you respawn.

This is an interface for you to bind hotkeys to functions on press and on release.
Use the cfg file hotkeys.lua.
